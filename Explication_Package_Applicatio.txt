		Explication of the package 'application' 

	This report is to expain how works the frame made for edit and place the landmarks. 



Class Cadre2 :

	This is the main class of the frame. An object Jframe who contain all thestructure of the Editor.

	Inside, there is all link to button & Menu. 

	At the begining, the frame load an object from ImageWing, it contain all the information about the image. ( Metadata's, size, number and position of each Landmark's)
	The fileImage is the file who contain the image. 

	
	IMPORTANT : 
		The person's who manage the project want the origins of all coordinates to be on the lower-left corner ( the same in mathematics).
		But in Java, if you change nothing, the origins is on the upper-left corner. 
		That's why I have to apply a little loop that change the Y coordinate each time i load the landmark (Because they told me to change when my project was almost finished).
		So it's very important to check that. 
		

	Cadre2 contain the method that call the object PanData (panel for the landmark on the right)
	It is hide by a Jslider and Show or didn't show with the function ToolBarEditing and ToolBarLandmark

	The action performed with circle and square was to check when the squareButton was pressed or not. 

	

	When you want to save : 
	
		Two ArrayList of Landmark are verify. One who contain all the landmark and their information  when you open the frame Cadre2, and an other who contain all your modification.
		If their is no difference, when you close the frame, the program didn't ask you if you want to save. 
		If you change the position of one landmark, the programm will propose to you to save. 
		If you do "Ctrl + s" All the list are update so the program won't ask you if you want to save. 
		Don't forget to send a list with the good origins of coordinates. 
		And change after, if not, their will be a lot of bug. 



	To call .exe file : 

		I've create an object "Afficheurflux" for get the BufferReader and read the programm. 
		It change the imager but as the image is open in your frame, it cannot refresh directly ! You have to close the frame and re-open it. 
	
		For the .exe file "LandmarkPrediction.exe", i get a String who contain two coordinate and a type (true or false). I add it to my list and it appear on screen. 


	
Class Affichage : 


	The second most important class. 

	This class contain all that remain to the image and the panel. 

	With that class, I apply all my function for add Landmark, Remove, modify, Display them, Ctrl + clic on them. 

	When a landmark is create, the location of the rightClick is saved. And it add to a list of landmark. 

	For each members of that list, I take the coordinate and add it to the object DrawCircle. 
	This object is for draw, display, change color and change the size of each circle. 

	
	All the mouse and Key Listener are create here. 
	Mouse listener is for Knowing if you clic on a circle or not, if you add a landmark on the image or not, ect. 
	Key Listener is to change the type of landmark. 

	For Add landmark : 

		You right click on a position, choose the type, and the Landmark is create. 
	
	For modify position : 

		You drag and drop them where you want. All is refresh and the new position is set. Don't forget to save after ! 

	For delete Landmark : 

		You press "CTRL" on your keyboard, and you LeftClick on all the landmark you want to delete. 
		All that landmark are add to an other list, that's why the color change. 
		Then you right click, the menu as change because the "ListSelectionLandmark" is not empty, and you click on "Delete" it remove all Landmark from that list. 

		If you have select a landmark that you don't want to modify, you can do "CTRL + Z" but after you can't "CTRL + Y" for put back in list. 

	
	For Change Type of landmark : 

		You Ctrl + clic on them, you right click and choose the type you want. 

	The method of Add landmark you want to delete or modify in an other list set easier to modify or delete them. In fact, when you put a landmark in the "SelectionLandmarkList" 
	You remove a landmark. And if you change the type, you create a new landmark. It's easier. 


	UNDO / REDO :

		The Undo and Redo mathod's are efficent for add and remove landmark you have create. But if you change the place of a landmark, it will not put back at the previous place. 
		The undo and redo mathod's are just Some list who save landmark and remove them but without forget their original position. 
		If you close the frame, all list are remove, so you cannot Ctrl + Z. 
		

	PrintCoordinate : 

		Function for print the coordinate on the PanData Panel. Their have the origins Change before write them on screen. 



	Paint Component : 

		Be very careful when you add or modify this function. 
		It's use for print elements on screen and make all append at the time you do it (The dot follow your mouse, the coordinates change directly, etc..). 

		When you resize image, all append here. 
		That's why you have to be carefull.

		When you resize the image (ZoomIn/ZoomOut), A coefficient is calculate. this Coefficient is the percentage of the Zoom. 

		For example : If i Zoom Out the image, the width and height are multiply by 0.9. 
				So, all the position of the landmark are multiply by 0.9. 
				And that, each time you resize or you drag and drop them. 

		If the image is ZoomIn and you add a landmark, the coefficient wil be apply on the coordinate of your mouse, like that the circle will be at the good place. 	
		It may be not precise, because the chief of the project want the landmark to be "int".
		So you will lose a lot of precision each time you zoom in and out. That's why the landmark move. 

		But if you don't save and come back all will be good. 
	 	If you change type to "double" everything must be better to my mind. 

		
	CircleSize : 
		This is a very very basic function to change the size of the circle when you ZoomIn or ZoomOut the image. 
		The return is the size of the circle 

	all the functions below are use for add landmark at the good position. 





Class drawCircle : 

	This is an objectthat draw an modify circles. 
	This class get a Graphic object,
	A X and Y position 
	A size (r)
	a type 
	A type to know if it's selected or not
	And a int to dispalay them. 

	When you draw a circle, if you know the width of the circle, it's important to draw the circle in the middle of the mouse. 
	That's why i have to put the "xCenter - r" because if i didn't do that, the circle will not be center a the top of the mouse. 

	
class PanData : 

	Class who welcome all the landmark to print them on a panel on the frame of Cadre2.
	
	

	
			    
Every important static function are and should be in the Facade.
